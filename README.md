# Civ-VII-District-Mod
Bringing districts back.

The goal is to add the fun part of city planning back to CivVII with unique districts that award placement.

We use `https://github.com/izica/civ7-modding-tools` as a builder for xml files. This allows us to code in typescript and generate xml.

To run do `npm install`

To build `npx tsx scripts/disctrict_mod.ts`

The output will be in the `dist` directory

# To use the mod
To use, unzip contents of folder to:
C:\[YOUR_USER]\AppData\Local\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VII\Mods

# Thanks

A huge thanks to my friends, Izica for making a great modding tool and slothoth for helping me troubleshoot!
